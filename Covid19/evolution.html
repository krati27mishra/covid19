    <h1><b>Evolution of Covid-19</b></h1>
    <h3><i>Epidemiology, Evolution, and Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives</i></h3>
    <p>The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan turned into a public health emergency of international concern. With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective. Here, we report the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak. Originated in bats, 2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans at a concentrated source of transmission. Similarities of receptor sequence binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier for transmission of the virus to farm animals. We propose, based on the One Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic</p>

<p>As animal markets had been implicated in the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002–2003, and initial 2019-nCoV infections are also related to the seafood market with wildlife trading, it was soon assumed that wild animals were also involved in the emergence of 2019-nCoV. Yet, from which species and under what circumstance the virus crossed the species barrier to infect humans remains to be clarified. Early investigations about the origin of COVID-19 suggested that the 2019-nCoV may have jumped from bats to human.This is not unprecedented since bat viruses have been shown to ‘jump’ the species barrier frequently to infect new species.However, since bats were in hibernation when the outbreak occurred, and it was uncertain whether bats were sold at the market, the virus is more likely to have been transmitted via other species on the market. Genomic analyses of 2019-nCoV demonstrate a 96% nucleotide identity with a CoV isolated from a bat: BetaCoV/RaTG13/2013 [42]. Previous reports showed that species from the bat genera Rhinolophus in southern China are a rich pool of SARS-like-CoVs, which belong to the subgenera Sarbecovirus. These viruses exhibit rich genetic diversity and frequent recombination events, which may increase thepotential for cross-species transmission.

   <p>Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965. It caused a common cold. Later that decade, researchers found a group of similar human and animal viruses and named them after their crown-like appearance.

Seven coronaviruses can infect humans. The one that causes SARS emerged in southern China in 2002 and quickly spread to 28 other countries. More than 8,000 people were infected by July 2003, and 774 died. A small outbreak in 2004 involved only four more cases. This coronavirus causes fever, headache, and respiratory problems such as cough and shortness of breath.

MERS started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Almost all of the nearly 2,500 cases have been in people who live in or travel to the Middle East. This coronavirus is less contagious than its SARS cousin but more deadly, killing 858 people. It has the same respiratory symptoms but can also cause kidney failure.

<p>Of the hundreds of coronaviruses known to exist, many are relatively harmless. Coronaviruses infect your nose, sinuses and upper throat but often result in nothing more than a common cold.</p>

<p>Roundtable moderator Suresh Subramani, distinguished professor emeritus in the Division of Biological Sciences and director of the Tata Institute for Genetics and Society, framed the program by highlighting three major areas of concern surrounding the pandemic and how it impacts our daily lives: the rapid spread of the virus over the past three months; the ominous morbidity and mortality rates of the disease, which threaten to overwhelm global health care systems; and the immense reservoir of carriers of the disease.“It is estimated that there may be tenfold more asymptomatic carriers of the disease, which means that there could be over seven-and-a-half million carriers worldwide,” said Subramani. “This is a disease that is spreading very rapidly across the globe, so these faculty are here to share their knowledge regarding the biology of the virus and why this pandemic has brought the world to its knees.”</p>

<p>Emily Troemel, a professor who studies host-pathogen interactions in the Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, kicked off the discussion by describing basic biological aspects of coronaviruses, including how health workers test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and facets scientists have learned about the virus’ genome.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses, as Troemel noted, feature RNA-based genomes, unlike most of life on the planet, which feature DNA genomes. RNA genomes in coronaviruses are positive-sense, which are similar to the cell’s own messenger RNA and allows these viruses to immediately hijack the protein synthesis machinery of host cells. This feature enables these viruses to quickly and effectively take over host cells and rapidly expand.</p>

<p>“Knowing that it has RNA in its genome helps us understand how we test for the presence of coronavirus,” said Troemel. “In addition, we are able to look at changes in the sequence in the viral genome and that’s enabling us to track the spread of this virus around the globe…. We can learn about how the biology of the virus is changing and how it may be altering the way it interacts with host cells, and also potentially different ways that we could treat it. It’s part of an amazing open science effort with an unprecedented level of information acquisition and information sharing among researchers.”Matt Daugherty, an assistant professor in the Section of Molecular Biology, studies the evolutionary arms race that pits the immune systems of hosts on one hand and pathogens on the other. He covered aspects such as how SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses enter the human population and become pandemics; how SARS-CoV-2 relates to past and present epidemic viruses in the human population; and, based on what scientists have learned from other viruses, what we can expect in terms of long-term immunity and co-existence with SARS-CoV-2.
</p>

<p>
“We as a species are always being exposed to viruses,” Daugherty noted.
</p>
<p>Since SARS-CoV-2 is so new, there are many key unknowns related to human immune defenses against it, Daugherty said. Even with coronaviruses that cause common colds, it’s unclear whether humans develop long-term immunity to these viruses or need to continually develop new immunities.</p>
<p>“One thing I take comfort in with all of these other viruses is knowing that we aren’t constantly dealing with influenza pandemics and other pandemic viruses, and that’s because of the largely effective role of our immune system in dealing with these viruses once the immune system has been prepared,” said Daugherty.</p>
<p>For a virus that originated in an animal species to successfully infect humans, it needs to adapt to a range of genetic differences between the original host species and humans. But effective vaccines can ultimately thwart such pathogens.</p>
<p>“We have really good ways of making effective vaccines, and the hope is that this will hold for SARS-CoV-2 as well,” said Daugherty. “I take some comfort in knowing that these types of pandemics do pass and we will get through this.”</p>
<p>Justin Meyer, an assistant professor in the Section of Ecology, Behavior and Evolution, discussed concepts related to science and society’s ability to predict future pandemics. These include variables that contribute to the spread of pathogens; the increased likelihood of future pandemics; and predictions for where the next pandemic is likely to occur.</p>
<img src="ldr.jfif" alt="">
<p>Factors that boost the risk of pandemics include human exposure to pathogens through meat consumption and contact with wild animals, increased human encroachment in wild areas and the exotic animal trade. Increased urbanization—more people living in close proximity means more opportunities for viruses to spread—and the rising consequences of climate change, also increase pandemic risks.</p>
<p>“We’re augmenting the temperature of the earth and environments in a way that we’re making ourselves more susceptible to diseases,” said Meyer. “When we warm the earth, we create more habitats for mosquitoes that carry vectors like malaria by increasing their range. They can spread to new human populations..... By increasing temperatures, we’re increasing flooding and there are many pathogens that are waterborne, such as cholera, which we will be exposing more and more people to.”
</p>

<p>During the roundtable discussion, Subramani prompted the scientists with a handful of questions, including: Since many coronaviruses are relatively harmless, what makes SARS-CoV-2 so damaging to the lungs? What is the appropriate vaccine target for SARS-CoV-2 and in what time frame—from validation to FDA approval—is a vaccine likely? Can we look to drug targets where vaccines have been developed for related viruses and would that timeline be the same? Is there any evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has a mutation rate that is extraordinarily high?</p>
<p>Based on their genomic sequencing analysis, Andersen and his collaborators concluded that evolution of SARS-CoV-2 followed one of two possible scenarios from its origins. In one scenario, the virus evolved into its current pathogenic state through natural selection in a non-human host, and then jumped to humans. This is how previous coronavirus outbreaks have emerged, with humans contracting the virus after direct exposure to civets, in the case of SARS, and to camels, in the case of MERS. The researchers have proposed bats as the most likely reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 as this virus is very similar to a bat coronavirus. There are no documented cases of direct bat-human transmission, however, suggesting that an intermediate host was likely involved somewhere between bats and humans.
